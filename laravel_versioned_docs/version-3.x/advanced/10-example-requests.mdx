# Example requests
For each endpoint, an example request is shown in [each language in your config](../reference/config#example-languages). If you aren't happy with the generated examples, you can change the template Scribe uses. You can also add a language which isn't included with Scribe by creating your own Blade template.

In this guide, we'll try it out by creating a template for Ruby. If you just want to edit an existing template, you should follow along, as it's almost exactly the same process.

## Step 1: Create template file
First, create a file called `{language-code}.md.blade.php` in the `resources/views/vendor/scribe/partials/example-requests` directory. Since we're creating a Ruby template, we'll create in this case, `ruby.md.blade.php`.

If you're editing an existing template, you can copy [the one Scribe uses](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/tree/master/resources/views/partials/example-requests) to create your own template.

:::tip
You can also run `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=scribe-examples` instead to automatically copy all Scribe's example templates to the vendor views directory. Note that this will publish *all* the example templates.

## Step 2: Write the template
In this Blade template, you'll write the Markdown for the example request. You have access to two variables, `$baseUrl` and `$endpoint`.

`$baseUrl` is the base URL for the API (for instance, `http://your-api.dev`).

`$endpoint` contains details about the current endpoint. It's an instance of `Knuckles\Camel\Output\OutputEndpointData` with the following properties:
- `httpMethods`: an array of the HTTP methods for that endpoint
- `boundUri`: the URL for the endpoint, with any url parameters replaced (`users/{id}` -> `users/1`)
- `headers`: key-value array of request headers
- `cleanQueryParameters`: key-value array of query parameters and examples
- `cleanBodyParameters`: key-value array of body parameters and examples
- `fileParameters`: key-value array of file parameters and examples. Each example is an instance of `\Illuminate\Http\UploadedFile`.

:::note
Parameters which have been excluded from the example requests (see [Specifying example values](../documenting/query-body-parameters#specifying-or-omitting-examples)) will not be present in `cleanQueryParameters`, `cleanBodyParameters`, or `fileParameters`.
:::

We can work with this information to write a basic Ruby template:

````php title=resources/views/vendor/scribe/ruby.md.blade.php
@php
    // Adding this so we get IDE code completion for $endpoint
    /** @var \Knuckles\Camel\Output\OutputEndpointData $endpoint */
@endphp
```ruby

require 'rest-client'

@if(!empty($endpoint->cleanBodyParameters))
body = {!! json_encode($endpoint->cleanBodyParameters, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT | JSON_UNESCAPED_UNICODE) !!}
@endif
@if(!empty($endpoint->headers))
headers = {
@foreach($endpoint->headers as $header => $value)
    "{{$header}}": "{{$value}}",
@endforeach
}
@endif

response = RestClient.{{strtolower($endpoint->httpMethods[0])}}(
  '{{ $baseUrl }}/{{ $endpoint->boundUri }}'@if(!empty($endpoint->cleanBodyParameters)),
  body @endif
@if(!empty($endpoint->headers)),
  headers
@endif
)

p response.body

```
````

As you can see, it's a regular Blade view, so we can use the usual Blade directives and constructs.

If you need more examples, you can check out the [included example requests](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/tree/master/resources/views/partials/example-requests).

:::tip
The `Knuckles\Scribe\Tools\WritingUtils` class contains some helpful utilities that might save you some work; for instance, printing query parameters as a key-value hash.

## Step 3: Add to config

Finally, if you added a new language template, add the language to the `example_languages` array in your config and generate your documentation as usual.

```php {3} title=config/scribe.php
'example_languages' => [
  'javascript',
  'ruby',
] 
 ```

Now run `php artisan scribe:generate`, and your example requests should include a `ruby` tab:
