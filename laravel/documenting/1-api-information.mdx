# General API info
You can add basics such as the title, introductory text, base URL and authentication information in your `scribe.php` config file.

## Title
To set the HTML `<title>` for the generated docs, use the `title` key. This title will also be used in the Postman collection and OpenAPI spec.

```php title=config/scribe.php
  'title' => 'The SideProject API',
```

If you leave `title` empty, Scribe will infer it from the value of `config('app.name')`.

## Description and introductory text
You can add a description of your API using the `description` key. This description will be displayed in the docs' "Introduction" section, and in the Postman collection and OpenAPI spec.

The `intro_text` key is where you'll set the text shown in the "Introduction" section of your docs (after the `description`).

Markdown and HTML are also supported (see [HTML helpers](../reference/html))

```php title=config/scribe.php
  'description' => 'Start (and never finish) side projects with this API.',
  'intro_text' => <<<INTRO
This documentation will provide all the information you need to work with our API.

<aside>
As you scroll, you'll see code examples for working with the API in different programming languages in the dark area to the right (or as part of the content on mobile).
You can switch the language used with the tabs at the top right (or from the nav menu at the top left on mobile).

INTRO

## Base URL
:::note
The base URL is the URL _displayed_ in your docs (so you can also call it the _display url_). It is separate from the URL used in the API tester (Try It Out), which you can set with the `try_it_out.base_url` config key.
:::

By default, Scribe will use the current app URL (`config('app.url')`) as the display URL. However, you can customise this with the `base_url` key. For example, setting the `base_url` to this:

```php title=config/scribe.php
  'base_url' => 'http://sideprojects.knuckles.wtf',
```

...means that `http://sideprojects.knuckles.wtf` will be shown in the generated docs, even if you ran the `generate` command on localhost or in CI.


## Logo
Maybe you've got a pretty logo for your API or company, and you'd like to display that on your documentation page. No worries! To add a logo, set the `logo` key in `scribe.php` to the path of the logo. Here are your options:

- To point to an image on an external public URL, set `logo` to that URL.
   ```php
   'logo' => 'http://your-company/logo.png',
   ```
- To point to an image in your codebase:
  - if you're using `laravel` type docs, set `logo` to the `public_path()` of the image
  - if you're using `static` type, pass in the path to the image relative to the `public/docs` directory.

  For example, if your logo is in `public/images`:
   ```php
   // static type
   'logo' => '../img/logo.png',
   // laravel type
   'logo' => 'img/logo.png',
   ```
- If you don't want a logo, set `logo` to `false`.

## Authentication
You can add authentication information for your API using the `auth` section in `scribe.php`.

:::important
Scribe uses the auth information you specify for four things:
  - Generating an "Authentication" section in your docs
  - Adding auth information to the Postman collection and OpenAPI spec
  - Adding authentication parameters to your example requests for endpoints that use authentication
  - Adding the necessary auth parameters with the specified value to response calls for endpoints that use authentication
:::

To configure auth, first you need to specify the `auth.in` and `auth.name` values for your API. They state the type of the auth parameter and its name, respectively. You also need to set `auth.enabled` to `true`. Some examples:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
    defaultValue="bearer"
    values={[
        {label: 'Bearer auth', value: 'bearer'},
        {label: 'Basic auth', value: 'basic'},
        {label: 'Custom header', value: 'header'},
        {label: 'Body parameter', value: 'body'},
        {label: 'Query parameter', value: 'query'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="bearer">

For an API which uses a bearer token in an Authorization header (for instance, `Authorizqtion: Bearer i0d7jow867tR09Zx`).

```php title=config/scribe.php
return [
  'auth' => [
    // ...
    'enabled' => true,
    'in' => 'bearer',
    'name' => 'Authorization', // <-- This value is ignored, as the header name is always "Authorization"
  ],
];
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="basic">

For an API which uses basic auth (for instance, `Authorizqtion: Basic i0d7jow867tR09Zx==`).

```php title=config/scribe.php
return [
  'auth' => [
    // ...
    'enabled' => true,
    'in' => 'basic',
    'name' => 'Authorization', // <-- This value is ignored, as the header name is always "Authorization"
  ],
];
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="header">

For an API which uses a token in a custom header (for instance, `Api-Key: i0d7jow867tR09Zx`).

```php title=config/scribe.php
return [
  'auth' => [
    // ...
    'enabled' => true,
    'in' => 'header',
    'name' => 'Api-Key', // <-- The name of the header
  ],
];
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="body">

For an API which uses a token in an body parameter.

```php title=config/scribe.php
return [
  'auth' => [
    // ...
    'enabled' => true,
    'in' => 'body',
    'name' => 'apiKey', // <-- The name of the body parameter
  ],
];
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="query">

For an API which uses a token in an query parameter.

```php title=config/scribe.php
return [
  'auth' => [
    // ...
    'enabled' => true,
    'in' => 'query',
    'name' => 'apiKey', // <-- The name of the query parameter
  ],
];
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
Scribe will automatically turn your auth information into text in the docs. To customise the generated text (or change to a different language), use Laravel's translation system. You can publish Scribe's default translations using `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=scribe-translations`.
:::

There are some other settings that you have to set in the `auth` array. Here'sa full example and explanation:


```php title=config/scribe.php
return [
  // ...
  'auth' => [
    'enabled' => true,
    'default' => false,
    'in' => 'bearer',
    'name' => 'Authorization',
    'use_value' => env('SCRIBE_AUTH_KEY'),
    'placeholder' => '{ACCESS_TOKEN}',
    'extra_info' => 'You can retrieve your token by visiting your dashboard and clicking <b>Generate API token</b>.',
  ],
];
```

- The `default` field describes the most common behaviour of your API. If most of your endpoints are authenticated, set this to `true`, then use `@unauthenticated` on the method docblock if you need to turn off auth for specific endpoints. If your endpoints are open by default, leave this as `false`, then use `@authenticated` on the method doc block to turn on auth for specific endpoints.
- The `use_value` field is only used by Scribe for response calls. During generation, if an endpoint requires auth, Scribe will pass this value. It _won't_ be included in the generated output or examples.
  :::tip
  If you need to dynamically generate the auth value for response calls, use the [`beforeResponseCall()` method](responses#authentication-and-customization) instead.
  :::
- The `placeholder` is the opposite of `use_value`. It will be used only as a placeholder in the generated example requests.
- The `extra_info` text is appended to the auth description Scribe generates. A good idea would be to tell your users where to get their auth key.
