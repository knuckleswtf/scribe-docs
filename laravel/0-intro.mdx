# Introduction

Scribe helps you generate API documentation for humans from your Laravel codebase. See a live example at [demo.scribe.knuckles.wtf](https://demo.scribe.knuckles.wtf).

## Features
- Useful output:
  - Pretty single-page HTML doc, with human-friendly text, code samples, and in-browser API tester ("Try It Out")
  - Generates Postman collection and OpenAPI spec
- Smarts. Scribe can:
  - extract request parameter details from FormRequests or validation rules
  - safely call API endpoints to get sample responses
  - generate sample responses from Eloquent API Resources or Transformers
- Customisable to different levels:
  - Customise the UI by adjusting text, ordering, examples, or change the UI itself
  - Add custom strategies to adjust how data is extracted
  - Statically define extra endpoints or information that isn't in your codebase

Wondering where to start? Try one of these:

- the [getting started guide](/laravel/getting-started)
- [What's new](/blog/laravel-v5)

If you're coming from `mpociot/laravel-apidoc-generator`, first [migrate to v3](/laravel/3.x/migrating-apidoc)`, then to each succeeding version.

:::tip
Scribe helps you generate docs automatically, but if you really want to make friendly, maintainable and testable API docs, there's some more stuff you need to know. So I made [a course](https://shalvah.teachable.com/p/api-documentation-for-developers?utm_source=scribe-laravel-docs&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=none) for you.ðŸ¤—

## Installation

:::info Requirements
PHP 8.1 and Laravel 9 or higher are required.
:::

First, add the package via Composer:

```sh
composer require --dev knuckleswtf/scribe

Then complete the installation:

Publish the config file by running:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=scribe-config
```
This will create a `scribe.php` file in your `config` folder.
