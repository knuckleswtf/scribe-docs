# Introduction

Scribe helps you generate API documentation for humans from your Laravel/Lumen/[Dingo](https://github.com/dingo/api) codebase. See a live example at [demo.scribe.knuckles.wtf](https://demo.scribe.knuckles.wtf).

## Features
- Useful output:
  - Pretty single-page HTML doc, with human-friendly text, code samples, and in-browser API tester ("Try It Out")
  - Generates Postman collection and OpenAPI spec
- Smarts. Scribe can:
  - extract request parameter details from FormRequests or validation rules
  - safely call API endpoints to get sample responses
  - generate sample responses from Eloquent API Resources or Transformers
- Customisable to different levels:
  - Customise the UI by adjusting text, ordering, examples, or change the UI itself
  - Add custom strategies to adjust how data is extracted
  - Statically define extra endpoints or information that isn't in your codebase

If you're coming from `mpociot/laravel-apidoc-generator`, first [migrate to v3](/laravel/3.x/migrating-apidoc)`, then [to v4](/laravel/migrating-v4).

:::tip
Scribe helps you generate docs automatically, but if you really want to make friendly, maintainable and testable API docs, there's some more stuff you need to know. So I made [a course](https://shalvah.teachable.com/p/api-documentation-for-developers?utm_source=scribe-laravel-docs&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=none) for you.ðŸ¤—

## Installation

:::info Requirements
PHP 8.0 and Laravel/Lumen 8 or higher are required.
:::

First, add the package via Composer:

```sh
composer require --dev knuckleswtf/scribe
```

Then complete the installation:

import {LaravelLumenTabs, TabItem} from '@site/src/components/LaravelLumenTabs';

<LaravelLumenTabs>
<TabItem value="laravel">

Publish the config file by running:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=scribe-config
```
This will create a `scribe.php` file in your `config` folder.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="lumen">

1. Copy the config file from `vendor/knuckleswtf/scribe/config/scribe.php` to your project as `config/scribe.php`.
2. Add these lines to your `bootstrap/app.php`. They'll ensure that Scribe is loaded, but only in your dev environment:

   ```php title="bootstrap/app.php"
   if (class_exists(\Knuckles\Scribe\ScribeServiceProvider::class)) {
       $app->register(\Knuckles\Scribe\ScribeServiceProvider::class);
       $app->configure('scribe');
   }
   ```
3. Add these lines to your `Console/Kernel.php` to enable Artisan commands:

   ```php title="Console/Kernel.php"
   use Laravel\Lumen\Application;

   public function __construct(Application $app)
    {
        parent::__construct($app);
        if (class_exists(\Knuckles\Scribe\Commands\GenerateDocumentation::class)) {
            $this->commands[] = \Knuckles\Scribe\Commands\GenerateDocumentation::class;
        }
        if (class_exists(\Knuckles\Scribe\Commands\MakeStrategy::class)) {
            $this->commands[] = \Knuckles\Scribe\Commands\MakeStrategy::class;
        }
        if (class_exists(\Knuckles\Scribe\Commands\Upgrade::class)) {
            $this->commands[] = \Knuckles\Scribe\Commands\Upgrade::class;
        }
    }
   ```

</TabItem>
</LaravelLumenTabs>
