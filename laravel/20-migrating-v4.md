# Migrating to v4

welcome to Scribe v4.ðŸ‘‹ This guide will help you migrate from v3. Not much changed, so you should be done in less than 5 minutes. See [the release blog post](/blog/laravel-v4) for the list of new features.

## Requirements
Scribe v4 requires PHP 8 and Laravel 8+. If you're on an older version, you'll need to upgrade. 

## Start
Upgrade the package version (`knuckleswtf/scribe`) in your `composer.json` to `^4.0` and then install:

```bash
composer update knuckleswtf/scribe
```

## Automated upgrade
Scribe v4 comes with an upgrade tool that will make the needed changes to your config file and inform you of any manual changes you need to make yourself:

```shell
# See what changes will be made:
php artisan scribe:upgrade --dry-run
# Run the upgrade for real
php artisan scribe:upgrade
```

The tool will back up your old config to `config/scribe.php.bak` so you can restore it if something wasn't set correctly.

:::tip
If you use [multi-docs](/laravel/tasks/generating#generating-multiple-docs), you can run the upgrade command for each of your config files, for instance `php artisan scribe:upgrade --config scribe_admin`

## Config file changes
:::tip
`php artisan scribe:upgrade` automatically handles all the changes in this section.
:::

- A new `examples` key has been added, to configure how Scribe generates examples. It comes with two keys:
  - `faker_seed` (the old top-level `faker_seed` was moved here) 
  - `models_source`, for configuring how Scribe generates example models for API resources and transformers. See [the docs](/laravel/reference/config#models_source) for usage.
- A new `groups` key has been added. It comes with two items:
  - `default` (the old `default_group` was moved here)
  - `order`, where you can order your groups, subgroups and endpoints. See [the docs](/laravel/tasks/sorting-and-inheritance) for usage.

## Endpoints sorting
:::tip
`php artisan scribe:upgrade` automatically handles all the changes in this section.
:::

In the past, the only way to sort your endpoints was by naming them in alphabetical order (eg "1. Users", "2. Tasks"), or reordering them in the generated YAML files. The first approach makes your documentation ugly, the second isn't very scalable. Scribe v4 brings [a simpler approach](/laravel/tasks/sorting-and-inheritance): list the groups and endpoints in the `groups.order` config item, in the order you want them in.

Because of this, we've dropped support for the previous editing/renaming files approach, as well as `beforeGroup` and `afterGroup` on custom endpoints. Migrating is simple: when you run `scribe:upgrade`, it will automatically import the existing order of your groups into the `groups.order` key.


## Plugin API
If you've written custom strategies, the class interface has changed a tiny bit.

- The `$routeRules` parameter of `__invoke()` is now optional. This means you should replace `array $routeRules` with `array $routeRules = []`

  ```diff
  public function __invoke(
    ExtractedEndpointData $endpointData, 
  - array $routeRules
  + array $routeRules = []
  ): ?array
  ```

- There's a new instance property, `public ?ExtractedEndpointData $endpointData;`. You can add this anywhere in your class. It's not used for anything, and it's not set in the constructor, so you can ignore it, but it's a handy container to set/retrieve the endpoint being processed without having to pass it around.


## Blade templates
(For those who published and customized the themes' templates)

No major changes, but three things to note:
1. Because of the addition of subgroups, we had to make some changes to the `groups.blade.php` file.
2. We moved the logic that generates headings for the `sidebar.blade.php` into a `getHeadings` method in the `HtmlWriter` class.
3. We changed response fields so they can expand/collapse like body parameters. To do this, we:
   - added a `nestedResponseFields` property to the `OutputEndpointData` class.
   - renamed `body-parameters.blade.php` to `nested-fields.blad.php`, and renamed the `parameters` input parameter to `fields`.
  [Here's the commit](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/commit/00b09bbea8ec64006db864bf807004d48926c6d3).

If you're affected by these changes, we recommend you copy the new files from the project's repo, and make any changes you had (they're fairly small files).

## Attributes
To enable PHP 8 attributes, you'll need to manually add the needed strategies to your config file:

```diff title="config/scribe.php"
'strategies' => [
    'metadata' => [
        Strategies\Metadata\GetFromDocBlocks::class,
+       Strategies\Metadata\GetFromMetadataAttributes::class,
    ],
    'urlParameters' => [
        Strategies\UrlParameters\GetFromLaravelAPI::class,
        Strategies\UrlParameters\GetFromLumenAPI::class,
+       Strategies\UrlParameters\GetFromUrlParamAttribute::class,
        Strategies\UrlParameters\GetFromUrlParamTag::class,
    ],
    'queryParameters' => [
        Strategies\QueryParameters\GetFromFormRequest::class,
        Strategies\QueryParameters\GetFromInlineValidator::class,
+       Strategies\QueryParameters\GetFromQueryParamAttribute::class,
        Strategies\QueryParameters\GetFromQueryParamTag::class,
    ],
    'headers' => [
        Strategies\Headers\GetFromRouteRules::class,
+       Strategies\Headers\GetFromHeaderAttribute::class,
        Strategies\Headers\GetFromHeaderTag::class,
    ],
    'bodyParameters' => [
        Strategies\BodyParameters\GetFromFormRequest::class,
        Strategies\BodyParameters\GetFromInlineValidator::class,
+       Strategies\BodyParameters\GetFromBodyParamAttribute::class,
        Strategies\BodyParameters\GetFromBodyParamTag::class,
    ],
    'responses' => [
+       Strategies\Responses\UseResponseAttributes::class,
        Strategies\Responses\UseTransformerTags::class,
        Strategies\Responses\UseApiResourceTags::class,
        Strategies\Responses\UseResponseTag::class,
        Strategies\Responses\UseResponseFileTag::class,
        Strategies\Responses\ResponseCalls::class,
    ],
    'responseFields' => [
+       Strategies\ResponseFields\GetFromResponseFieldAttribute::class,
        Strategies\ResponseFields\GetFromResponseFieldTag::class,
    ],
],
```

Finally, if you'd like to automatically replace (most of) your docblock tags with attributes (see [the docs on annotations](/laravel/reference/annotations) for advantages and disadvantages), you can also do that. We've provided [a Rector rule](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe-tags2attributes) to automatically convert certain tags to attributes.
